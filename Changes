Revision history for Perl extension CM::Permutation.

0.9  Mon Jul 18 06:12:47 EEST 2011
        - Switched to GLUT API from OpenGL.pm instead of the GL API, main reason was trouble with the upgrade of OpenGL package from CPAN to 0.64 
            (faces of the cubies weren't showing up because of the upgrade, switching to GLUT fixed that)
 
      	- Added product group
		- Added tuple elements
		- Added tests for tuple and product group
		- Added some nice POD
		- Added factor group and commutator group
		- Added morphism class and test with first isomorphism theorem

        - Added Dihedral group
        - Added ModuleMultiplicativeGroup
        - Added CM::Rubik which models the rubik's cube
        - Added an OpenGL application to visualize the moves of the Rubik's cube
        - Added some more tests

        - Added some more documentation.
        - Added CM::Group::Altern
        - Replaced bithacks with Bit::Vector
        - Added Dimino's algorithm for computing all elements of a subgroup of S_n given its generators
